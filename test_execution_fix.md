# Test Plan for Strategy Execution Fix

## Summary of Changes

1. **Added comprehensive logging for strategy execution**:
   - "Starting strategy execution: [strategy name]" when execution begins
   - "Executing step [N]/[total]: [tool name]" for each step
   - "Strategy execution complete: [N] steps executed" when finished
   - "Recording execution for strategy" when sending to learning service

2. **Fixed step tracking**:
   - Reset `context.currentStep = 0` and `context.stepsCompleted = 0` before execution
   - Increment `context.stepsCompleted++` after each successful step
   - Update `context.currentStep` as steps progress
   - Store step results with `context.storeStepResult()`

3. **Added error handling**:
   - Log when MCP clients are not ready
   - Log detailed errors for step failures
   - Handle optional vs required steps properly
   - Added default case for unknown tools in `buildToolArguments`

4. **Enhanced visibility**:
   - Log strategy selection with step count
   - Log tool calls with arguments
   - Log execution duration for each step
   - Added streaming events for execution progress

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When a query is processed:

1. Strategy generation logs:
   ```
   Generated strategy 'dynamic_strategy' with 5 steps
   ```

2. Execution start logs:
   ```
   Starting strategy execution: dynamic_strategy with 5 steps for conversation [id]
   ```

3. Per-step logs:
   ```
   Executing step 1/5: analyze_query for conversation [id]
   Calling MCP tool 'analyze_query' on server 'oracle-query-analysis' with args: {...}
   MCP tool 'analyze_query' completed successfully in 123ms
   Step 1 completed: analyze_query - Total completed: 1
   ```

4. Completion logs:
   ```
   Strategy execution complete: dynamic_strategy - 5 steps executed for conversation [id]
   Recording execution for strategy: dynamic_strategy with 5 completed steps
   Pipeline completed successfully for conversation [id]
   ```

## Key Fixes

1. **Execution is now properly tracked** - The `stepsCompleted` counter accurately reflects executed steps
2. **Clear execution flow** - Logs show: generate → validate → execute → record
3. **No more jumping from generation to recording** - Execution phase is clearly visible
4. **ConversationContext properly updated** - Current step and completed steps are maintained

## Testing Steps

1. Start the system and ensure OracleDBAnswererHost loads with MCP clients
2. Send a query that triggers dynamic strategy generation
3. Monitor logs for the execution pattern above
4. Verify that `stepsCompleted` > 0 in the recording phase
5. Check that step results are properly accumulated

The fix ensures that strategies are not just generated but actually executed step by step with proper tracking and logging.

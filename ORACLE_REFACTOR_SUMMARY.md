# Oracle MCP Servers Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored 4 Oracle MCP servers to use the centralized OracleConnectionManager instead of creating their own database connections.

## Servers Refactored

### 1. OracleQueryExecutionServer
- **Previous**: Created direct JDBC connection using DriverManager
- **Now**: Uses OracleConnectionManager for all database operations
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removed dbConnection field and connection constants
  - Updated executeQuery to use connectionManager.executeQuery() for SELECT statements
  - Updated executeQuery to use connectionManager.executeUpdate() for DML statements
  - Refactored getSchemaInfo to use connectionManager.listTables() and getTableMetadata()

### 2. OracleSQLValidationServer
- **Previous**: Created direct JDBC connection using DriverManager
- **Now**: Uses OracleConnectionManager.executeWithConnection() for complex operations
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added new executeWithConnection() method to OracleConnectionManager for custom operations
  - Updated performSchemaValidation, performExecutionValidation, performPermissionCheck methods
  - Updated explainPlan and findSimilarTable methods to use connection pool

### 3. OracleSchemaIntelligenceServer
- **Previous**: Created direct JDBC connection using DriverManager
- **Now**: Uses OracleConnectionManager for all database operations
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated loadSchemaIfNeeded to use executeWithConnection()
  - Refactored analyzeColumnSemantics and findRelationships methods
  - Simplified discoverSampleData to use connectionManager.executeQuery()

### 4. OracleSQLGenerationServer
- **Previous**: Created direct JDBC connection for EXPLAIN PLAN operations
- **Now**: Uses OracleConnectionManager.executeWithConnection() for EXPLAIN PLAN
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated getExplainPlan method to use connection pool
  - Only used connection for optimization operations

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Connection Pooling**: All servers now share a centralized connection pool (5-20 connections)
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced number of database connections from 4 separate connections to a shared pool
3. **Consistent Error Handling**: Centralized connection management with retry logic
4. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in connection health checks through OracleConnectionManager
5. **Simplified Lifecycle**: Servers no longer manage their own connection lifecycle

## OracleConnectionManager Enhancement

Added a new public method to support custom database operations:
```java
public <T> Future<T> executeWithConnection(Function<Connection, T> operation)
```
This allows servers to perform complex database operations while still using the connection pool.

## Compilation Status
All servers compile successfully with the refactored code.
